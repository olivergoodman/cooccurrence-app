		<p>Word cooccurrence can be a useful technique when analyzing bodies of text. Studying which combinations of words frequently appear together has many important applications in natural language processing (NLP). In speech recognition, for example, word cooccurrence can be very helpful when trying to determine a certain sequence of words. In this project, I explored the use of word cooccurrence to take a broader look at the different types of language different people tend to gravitate towards. I compiled two corpuses of presidential candidate speeches, one of Barack Obama in 2008-2009 and another of Donald Trump in 2015-2016. </p>

		<p>To keep track of word cooccurrences, I first cleaned and organized the corpuses. I decided to remove all stop words from each corpus, although in different NLP studies they could be included to examine their significance in a specifc document. Using the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit</a>, I kept track of both individual tokens and sentences in each corpus. For the purpose of this project, I considered each sentence as its own document. By examining each sentence, I compiled a cooccurrence matrix mapping the number of cooccurrences a given word had with other words within a document. Feel free to look at the specific implementation <a href="https://github.com/olivergoodman/cooccurrence-app">here</a>!</p>
